CyberGIS Scripts (cybergis-scripts)
================

## Description

This repository contains scripts used in the CyberGIS.  The scripts contained herein are written in BASH and python.  They have been developed on and for Ubuntu; however, they may work on other systems.  The bin folder includes all the scripts that will be added to the path.  The lib folder includes scripts that are not designed to be called directly off the command line.

See the guides in the cybergis-guides repo at [https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-guides/](https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-guides), for examples on using the scripts.

### CyberGIS
The Humanitarian Information Unit has been developing a sophisticated geographic computing infrastructure referred to as the CyberGIS. The CyberGIS provides highly available, scalable, reliable, and timely geospatial services capable of supporting multiple concurrent projects.  The CyberGIS relies on primarily open source projects, such as PostGIS, GeoServer, GDAL, GeoGit, OGR, and OpenLayers.  The name CyberGIS is dervied from the term geospatial cyberinfrastructure.

### ROGUE
The Rapid Opensource Geospatial User-Driven Enterprise (ROGUE) Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) is a two-year research & development project developing the technology for distributed geographic data creation and synchronization in a disconnected environement.  This new technology taken altogether is referred to as GeoSHAPE.  See [http://geoshape.org](http://geoshape.org) for more information.  HIU is leveraging the technology developed through ROGUE to build out the CyberGIS into a robust globally distributed infrastruture.

## Installation

These installation instructions are subject to change.  Right now, since there are non-debian package dependencies, you can really extract the scripts to whatever directory you want.  The instructions below are suggested as they mirror Linux best practices for external packages.  Please be careful when installing gdal-bin and python-gdal packages as they may require different version of some packages than other programs, such as the OpenGeo Suite.  It is recommended to test this and other GDAL scripts within a vagrant environment first.

As root, execute the following commands:
```
apt-get update
apt-get install -y curl vim git
apt-get install postgresql-client-common postgresql-client-9.1 libgeos-dev
#Only install gdal and numpy if it is needed and won't conflict with a different installation.
#gdal and numpy are only needed for cybergis-script-stretch.py, cybergis-script-burn-alpha.py, cybergis-script-hide-no-data.py, cybergis-script-pull-wfs.sh, cybergis-script-pull-arcgis.sh, and cybergis-script-pull-shapefile.sh
apt-get install -y gdal-bin python-gdal python-numpy

cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-scripts.git cybergis-scripts.git
cp cybergis-scripts.git/profile/cybergis-scripts.sh /etc/profile.d/

#For GeoGig operations, you need to have the GeoGig command line tools installed.

## Usage

### Development Environments

```
cybergis-script-env.sh [geonode|ittc]

    cybergis-script-env.sh geonode [install|reset]
    
    cybergis-script-env.sh rogue [install|reset]
    
    cybergis-script-env.sh maploom install
    
    cybergis-script-env.sh geogig [install|clear]
    
    cybergis-script-env.sh ittc install
    
````
### EC2

```
cybergis-script-ec2.sh [prod|dev] [resize|swap|delete_swap]

    cybergis-script-ec2.sh prod resize <dev>
    
    cybergis-script-ec2.sh prod swap <size> <file>
    
    cybergis-script-ec2.sh prod delete_swap <file>
```

### GeoServer
```
cybergis-script-geoserver.sh [prod|dev] [tune]

    cybergis-script-geoserver.sh prod tune <repo> <Xmx>
    
    cybergis-script-geoserver-import-styles.py --path PATH \
    --prefix PREFIX --geoserver GEOSEVER --username USERNAME \
    --password PASSWORD --verbose
```

### Imagery Processing

```
cybergis-script-ittc-stretch.py <input_file> <breakpoints_file> \
<output_file> <bands> --rows ROWS --threads THREADS --verbose 
```
```
cybergis-script-burn-alpha.py <input_file> <alpha_file> <alpha_band_index> <output_file> <rows> <threads>
```
```
cybergis-script-hide-no-data.py <input_file> <output_file>
```

### ROGUE

```
cybergis-script-init-rogue.sh [prod|dev] [use|rvm|gems|geonode|server|remote|remote2|aws|sns]
    
    cybergis-script-init-rogue.sh prod server [tms|geonode] <name> <url>
    cybergis-script-init-rogue.sh prod remote <user:password> <localRepoName> <localGeonodeURL> <remoteName> <remoteRepoName> <remoteGeoNodeURL> <remoteUser> <remotePassword>
    cybergis-script-init-rogue.sh prod remote2 <user:password> <repoURL> <remoteName> <remoteURL> <remoteUser> <remotePassword>
    cybergis-script-init-rogue.sh prod cron <direction> <user> <password> <localRepoName> <remoteName> <authorname> <authoremail> [hourly|daily|weekly|monthly]
    cybergis-script-init-rogue.sh prod cron2 <direction> <user> <password> <localRepoName> <remoteName> <authorname> <authoremail> <frequency>
```

To manually execute the post_commit_hook.py script that automates notification of GeoGit commits, you need to use GeoNode's pyton interpreter and not the system default.  This script requires that the AWS tools are installed and SNS is configured.  As root (`sudo su -`) run:
```
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=rogue_geonode.settings
/var/lib/geonode/bin/python /opt/cybergis-scripts.git/lib/rogue/post_commit_hook.py "test now"
```

### PostGIS

```
cybergis-script-postgis.sh [prod|dev] [install]

    cybergis-script-postgis.sh prod install [rds|local] <host> <port> <user> <password> <database> <template>
    
```

### Replication

```
cybergis-script-pull-wfs.sh <wfs> <namespace> <featuretype> <dbname> <dbuser> <dbpass> <table>
```
```
cybergis-script-pull-arcgis.sh <service> <field> <dbname> <dbuser> <dbpass> <table>
```
```
cybergis-script-pull-shapefile.sh <url> <shapefile> <dbname> <dbuser> <dbpass> <table>
```
